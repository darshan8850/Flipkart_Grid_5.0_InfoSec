Violations and Potential Situations:
The rules provide specific values that must be followed for various aspects of user interactions with the website. Violations could occur in the following situations:

If a user attempts to use HTTP instead of HTTPS, violating the SSL encryption requirement.
If a user tries to access a subdomain or domain other than the allowed values for their tier.
If a user attempts to access files that are not allowed for their tier.
If a user performs actions (e.g., write, delete) that are not permitted for their tier.
If a user makes requests with incorrect HTTP status codes.
If a user uses incorrect parameters in their requests.
If the website does not implement or enforce security controls like two-factor authentication, security monitoring, and secure file uploads.
If the website does not follow its data privacy policies and procedures.
Compliance with the specified values for each tier is essential to ensure security, privacy, and proper access control for different levels of users on the website. Deviations from these defined values could result in security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Therefore, it's crucial for the website to enforce these policies and ensure ethical user interactions.
