1. The end of the domain is the most important part to check.
The domain portion of a URL is what gives you insight into the source of a link. 
The domain can be found after the http://; in longer links, the domain ends prior to the first /. 
For example, in the link http://google.com/maps, the domain is google.com.

Seems straightforward, right? Wrong. Scammers will doctor domains to make them seem like something they 
aren’t. In the example of http://google.com.cust_login.ie, the domain is cust_login.ie, not google.com. 
And in http://accounts_login.cz/google.com, the domain is accounts_login.cz, not google.com.

In the last two examples, you can see why a user might think they are linking to a Google site as 
opposed to a malicious site. That is why it’s important to check the space between the http:// and 
the first / and watch out for things that don’t belong.

2. Hyphens and symbols are common in malicious links.
Legitimate websites don’t often have hyphens or symbols in their domain names. 
As with the examples noted in point #1, scammers will use these elements along 
with known brands to try to trick you. For example, www.google.com isn’t the same 
as www.google-search.com.

3. Beware of domains that are entirely numbers with hyphens.
Sometimes you will come across a domain that is shown just as an IP address (e.g., http://101.10.1.101).
With links like this, you have no way of knowing the real owner of the domain.
You should not click this type of URL unless you are familiar with the IP address and you know exactly 
where the link will take you.

4.A shortened URL, such as goo.gl/V4jVrx 
(This is an example of a shortened link that leads to our website.)
